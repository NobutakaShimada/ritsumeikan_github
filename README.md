# Week 4: extention (1차 샘플 예상 완료일 : 2/25)
catch up to the contents of previous weeks (no need additional documents) free programing and operations of robot by students' own theme (+)
In my plan, the part of machine learning or visiual processing will be included in Week 2 or 4. 4 weeks are too few for all contents of your e-manual and ML/CV so we are considering the extension of weeks from 4 to 5 or 6, for after 2021 year. ML part manuscript will be employed after 2021 so we would like to include ML in the translation.
